# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## IMPORTANT: Before Starting Any Task
- ALWAYS read ALL files in the memory-bank directory, as they contain critical context
    - read this at the start of every session.
- Do not start making changes until you are told to do so. Always present a plan before proceeding and ask for explicit approval.
- Follow instructions faithfully. If you find instructions are contradictory or impossible to follow, think and explain your problem.
- Limit yourself to simple focused solutions, do not overreach.

* To analyze code, always prefer the metals mcp interface if available.


**Note**: When triggered by **update memory bank**, MUST review every memory bank file, 
even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md  as it tracks current state.
