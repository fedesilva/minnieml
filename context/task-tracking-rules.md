# Task Tracking rules

This are NO EXCEPTION rules for working with the `context/tracking.md` file.

#### Active tasks 


* Active tasks are created by the user or on behalf of them 
  when explicitely commanded. Seek confirmation before proceeding 
  to edit them.


* Never change the description of a task unless commanded to do so.
* If a task is misleading or erroneous, bring it up, and stand by.


* **Seek confirmation and signoff** for a task before considering it finished.
* Before seeking confirmation, follow the post task-rules in `context/coding-rules.md`
* **Re-read the rules**: When executing "post task" or similar workflows, re-read `coding-rules.md` to verify all steps. Do not rely on memory.

* When the user confirms a task is done, ask if you can mark it complete, 
  **stand by for instructions**.

* If the user confirms or asks for a task to be complete, just mark it, 
  **never delete it**.



#### Recent Changes

* When the user requests, or confirms a task is done, log changes in recent changes.
