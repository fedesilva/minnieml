# Working Memory

Read [task-tracking-rules.md](task-tracking-rules.md) before changing task state.
This is the Author's active and near-term focus. The backlog lives in [tasks/](tasks/).

## Global Working Memory

- Record QA findings in [QA misses](tasks/qa-misses.md). Select individual items or related
  groups for cleanup; create dedicated tasks when they need their own plans.

## Active Tasks

### Lambda migration

- **Tracker:** [Unify lambdas](tasks/unify-lambdas.md)
- **Status:** in_progress
- **Current focus:** Agree the argument-expression shape contract and next bounded plan in
  [step 12](tasks/unify-lambdas.md#preserve-counters-and-argument-expressions-across-ownership-analysis).
  Expression-shape implementation and final task review remain pending.

### Module naming

- **Tracker:** [Prevent module symbol and output-name collisions](tasks/module-name-collisions.md)
- **Status:** planned
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Current focus:** Define module identity and naming rules that prevent symbol and output collisions.

### BUG: Conditional ownership hardening

- **Tracker:** [Make conditional ownership explicit in ownership operations](tasks/conditional-ownership-witnesses.md)
- **Status:** planned
- **Current focus:** Planned within Unify lambdas, together with its mixed-ownership
  consuming-transfer bug repair. Retain Boolean witnesses and make cleanup, consumption,
  and return operations consistently respect conditional ownership.
