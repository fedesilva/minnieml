### Codegen improvements

Feedback we got

Backend Optimization (TBAA): Your TBAA metadata (!0 = !{!"MML TBAA Root"}) distinguishes types, but you need to emit Scope Metadata (!alias.scope and !noalias) on the load/store instructions generated by your compiler.

Frontend/IR Optimization (Attribute): Since your IntArray is immutable (the struct container, not the data), you can mark the struct pointer argument as readonly or noalias if you pass by reference. But since you pass by value, you rely on LLVM's SROA (Scalar Replacement of Aggregates) to break the struct apart.
