# MinnieML

Building A statically typed, functional language, with an ML inspired syntax, managed effects in delimited contexts,
declarative low level capabilities and first class native interface.

## Name

The name of the language is MinnieML and we shorten it as mml.

## Task Planning and Management

If I say something that seems contradictory, stop and ask.

It's _critically_ important that you _break your work into blocks_ and wait for me to review and understand your changes after finishing each block and before proceeding with the next, _I appreciate it you taking this request seriously_.
