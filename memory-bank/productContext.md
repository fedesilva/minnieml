# MML Product Context

## Purpose

MinnieML (MML) aims to be a statically typed, functional language with ML-inspired syntax, managed effects in delimited contexts, declarative low-level capabilities, and first-class native interface.

The language's goal is to bridge the gap between high-level abstractions and low-level control, allowing developers to use a single language across diverse computing environments.

## Problems MML Solves

Based on the project documentation:

- Eliminates the need for domain-specific languages by providing a unified language that can be used across different platforms and contexts
- Addresses the challenge of having to learn multiple languages for different domains (web, mobile, embedded, etc.)
- Provides high-level abstractions while still allowing low-level control when needed
- Aims to offer a consistent programming model from "edge to cloud, from mobile to homes"

At this time this is a hobby project, a platform for me to learn and
experiment.

I do have hopes that I can use this language for other projects down the road.

## How MML Works

MML features:

- ML-inspired syntax with static typing
- First-class operators with definable precedence
- Pattern matching
- Type inference
- Managed effects in delimited contexts (TODO: Elaborate on this concept)
- Row polymorphism for flexible record types

TODO: Add more details about the language's operational model

## User Experience Goals

MML strives to create an experience where:

- Developers can learn one language and use it for diverse applications
- High-level abstractions are available by default, but low-level capabilities are accessible when needed
- The language and build tools are context-aware regarding platform capabilities and constraints

TODO: Add specific UX goals and design principles that guide MML's development
