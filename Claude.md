Read `AGENTS.md`, `context/coding-rules.md`, `context/task-tracking-rules.md` and `context/tracking.md`.

Follow instructions in those files (particularly coding rules and tracking rules section)
Failure to follow instructions in `AGENTS.md` or `context/*` wastes time and money.

Read the rest of the files under `context`  and all files in the `docs/design/` directory
as needed to complete tasks.

Once you finish reading the context:
* summarize your understanding
* STOP and take no action. 
* Wait for instructions.
