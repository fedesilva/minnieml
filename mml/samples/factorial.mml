#-
  Factorial function implementation using a unary postfix operator.
  
  This defines the factorial operation as a postfix '!' operator
  with precedence 95 and left associativity.
  
  Usage examples:
    5!     => 120
    3 + 4! => 3 + 24 = 27
-#
op ! (n: Int): Int 95 left = 
  if n <= 1 
  then 1 
  else n * (n - 1)!; # Recursive call to calculate factorial
